Kanbanbot
===

Not ready for anyone yet. I am using this to learn node.

Install
===
1. git clone
2. npm install
3. rename / populate local.json-dist
4. node app.js

Kanbanery Setup
===
1. Configure live url and add key to local.json
2. Add project api & url to local.json

Todo
===
1. Remove express I think it's over kill and standard http module should work fine
2. Make work with multiple channels
3. Write install/readme doc & tests
4. Optimize nconf loading
5. Figure out test page
